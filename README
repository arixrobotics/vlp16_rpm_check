My Velodyne VLP16 has an issue where the motor did not spin at the desired rpm value. Sometimes it is 0, sometimes a negative number. It is supposed to spin at 600 rpm (default). 

So this script will launch the VLP16 ROS package, then checks for the rpm. If it is less than 0.9*600, it will send a reset signal to the device. It will keep doing this until the desired rpm is met. 

Please check the Python code for dependencies. Or just run and you'll see what you need to pip install. 


Use this code at your own risk ok.
